This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development servers:

```bash
npm i

npm run dev

# then in a separate terminal run
node dist/server/server.js
```

Approximate time: Roughly 12-14 hours

Things I'd add:
- Click to enlarge
- Upload/Delete success messages
- Add files from Google Drive or another source
- Pagination
- React Query for cacheing to limit api calls
